# Twists


Give your games a Twist, if that is speedruns, "manhunt", or whatever you play.


## Worldless
Minecraft... but the world around you resets every 5 minutes.

`/twists.worldless time setdefault 6000` - Set the time per world; defaults to 6000 ticks or 5 minutes
`/twists.worldless start` - Start the "minigame", once started portal linking is through the temporary worlds. 
Portals will not work as intended in vanilla overworld.
`/twists.worldless pause` - If for any reason you need to pause the run without freezing the server with `tick freeze`
Note: this will not kick players back to the overworld.
