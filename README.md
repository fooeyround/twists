# Twists


Give your games a Twist, if that is speedruns, "manhunt", or whatever you play.

## Features:

### Worldless
Minecraft... but the world around you resets every 5 minutes.

*Portals will not work as intended in vanilla overworld.*

`/twists worldless time setdefault 6000` - Set the time per world; defaults to 6000 ticks or 5 minutes

`/twists worldless start` - Start the "minigame", once started portal linking is through the temporary worlds.

`/twists worldless pause` - If for any reason you need to pause the run without freezing the server with `tick freeze`
<br> 
*Note: this will not kick players back to the overworld.*
